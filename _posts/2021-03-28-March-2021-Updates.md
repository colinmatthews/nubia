# 1. Power Automate Desktop is FREE

You heard that right! Power Automate Desktop is now free for all users! Of course, this doesn't include advanced features such as AI Builder or Unattended flows. But, now every Windows user will be able to explore automation by simply installing PAD!

# 2. Databases can now be added from Power Automate

Previously, the process to get up and running with PAD was a lengthy one. It involved creating an organizational account, navigating to Power Apps to create a database, and then finally downloading and installing the application. Now, you can create a database directly in Power Automate Desktop! This will make things SO MUCH EASIER for new users.

# 3. Variables can be used in web recorders

Another great quality-of-life enhancement! This change allows you to pass a value collected from a webpage directly into a variable. The old way of typing some dummy text and updating within the flow can be completely forgotten!
